# RTyping

Very rough (like always) dalamud plugin for displaying the chat typing status of party members.

Shows an icon next to the player's job icon in the party list, and next to their nameplate if nearby.

## How to Use
The icons should appear automatically, the conditions for their appearance can be changed in the configuration menu from inside the Plugin Installer or with the `/rtyping` command.

## Installation
Add my [dalamud repository](https://github.com/apetih/MyDalamudPlugins) to Dalamud's Custom Plugin Repositories.

Once added, look for RTyping in the Plugin Installer.

## Special Thanks
* Wrex - For the plugin icon
